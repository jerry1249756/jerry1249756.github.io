Hi! I’m Che-Ming (Jerry) Chang, an incoming Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://gtcad.gatech.edu/" style="color: #4287f5;">Southern California Computer-Aided Design Lab (SCCAD)</a>, advised by Prof. Sung Kyu Lim. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in June 2024 and previously interned at IBM Research.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research interests lie in <strong>AI-driven Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</strong>. I’m particularly excited about applying machine learning to improve design scalability and quality.  In addition to EDA, I have hands-on experience across the digital VLSI design flow — from RTL to GDSII — using commercial tools like Synopsys Design Compiler and Cadence Innovus. Outside of research, I enjoy working out, playing volleyball, and playing the piano.
