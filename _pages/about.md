Hi! I’m Che-Ming (Jerry) Chang, an incoming Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://gtcad.gatech.edu/" style="color: #4287f5;">Georgia Tech Computer-Aided Design Lab (GTCAD)</a>, advised by Prof. Sung Kyu Lim. I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in June 2024.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research interests lie in <strong>AI-driven Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</strong>, with a focus on differentiable optimization and heterogeneous integration. I’m particularly excited about applying machine learning to improve design scalability and quality across the digital VLSI flow.
