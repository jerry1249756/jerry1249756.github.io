We proposed a method for Approximate Logic Synthesis (ALS) by applying the local approximate change (LACs) with a Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) engine. Our method includes LACs which can reduce the error rate with probability. With an alternation between LACs and exact circuit optimizations, we can explore better solutions compared to the existing ALS tool ALSRAC on EPFL benchmarks.
